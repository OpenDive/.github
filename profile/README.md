## 🔗 We are Web3 Native 
Born in the blockchain, and forged in a Bitcoin transaction, we've been part of the web3 space since its early days in 2011. We specialize in **gaming** 🕹️ and **immersive experiences** 🌌, though you might find us dabbling in blockchain + IoT and human-computer interaction too. 

**We are blockchain agnostic** 🌐. We've journeyed through various ecosystems, developing client-facing applications, contributing to open-source projects, and supporting ecosystems to achieve their goals.

## 📚 But, We're also Scholars
Our team includes academic researchers 🎓 with published research in diverse fields like robotics, telepresence, IoT, blockchain, and AI.

## 🏗️ Our Structure
We're organized into 3 teams, each focusing on different aspects of our mission: 

1. **IP Development**: Where we craft our own unique properties.
2. **Venture Partnerships**: Collaborating with partners on exciting ventures.
3. **Infrastructure Development**: Building the infrastructure for gaming.

We're also active investors 💰 in all things gaming and social.

## 🎲 In Gaming
We're currently developing the following IPs:

1. **OpenEra** 🏰
2. **Dargo's Arena** ⚔️
3. **Mayhem League** 🥊
