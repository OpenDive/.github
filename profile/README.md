### WE ARE WEB3 NATIVE
Born in the blockchain, forged in a Bitcoin transaction.   

Our team members made their first steps in the space in 2011, and officially in 2012.   
Our core focus in the web3 space is **gaming** and **immersive experiences**. Although, you may find a few publications related to blockchain + IoT and human-computer interaction work in web3.   

**We are blockchain agnostic**.   
As early pioneers in the cryptocurrency space, we believe in a multi-chain world and have dabbled in various ecosystems -- from developing client facing applications, hacking projects, contributing open source, or internally supporting ecosystems to achieve their goals.

### BUT, WITH A DIVERSE BACKGROUND
We are academic researchers with published research, working on the fields of robotics, telepresence, IoT, blockchain and AI.

### HOW WE ARE STRUCTURED
We are composed of 3 teams, that focus on developing our own IP, working with our venture partners, and developing gaming related infrastructure. Furthermore, we are actively investing across the industry in all things gaming and social.
